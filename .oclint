    # A few instances of "useless parentheses" errors are meaningful. Mostly
    # in the context of the `return` statement. Unfortunately the vast
    # majority would result in removing parentheses that decreases
    # readability. So we're going to ignore this warning and rely on humans to
    # notice when the parentheses are truly not needed.

    # Also, some macro expansions, such as FD_SET(), trigger this warning and
    # we don't want to suppress each of those individually.
